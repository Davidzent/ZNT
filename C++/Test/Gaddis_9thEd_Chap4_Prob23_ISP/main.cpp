 * Instructions:  
    * An Internet service provider has three different subscription packages for its customers:
    * Package A: For $9.95 per month 10 hours of access are provided. Additional hour
    * are $2.00 per hour.
    * Package B: For $14.95 per month 20 hours of access are provided. Additional hours
    * are $1.00 per hour.
    * Package C: For $19.95 per month unlimited access is provided.
    * Write a program that calculates a customerâ€™s monthly bill. It should ask which package
    * the customer has purchased and how many hours were used. It should then display
    * the total amount due.
    * Input Validation: Be sure the user only selects package A, B, or C. Also, the number
    * of hours used in a month cannot exceed 744.
 * -*- = possible changes
