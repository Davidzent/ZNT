 * Instructions: 
     * A liter is 0.264179 gallons. 
     * Write a program that will read in the number of liters of gasoline consumed by the userâ€™s car 
     * and the number of miles traveled by the car and will then output the number of miles per gallon the car delivered. 
     * Your program should allow the user to repeat this calculation as often as the user wishes. 
     * Define a function to compute the number of miles per gallon. 
     * Your program should use a globally defined constant for the number of liters per gallon.
     * Modify your program from Sav9EdC4P1 so that it will take input data for two cars
     * and output the number of miles per gallon delivered by each car. 
     * Your program will also announce which car has the best fuel efficiency (highest number of miles per gallon).
